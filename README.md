## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/users](http://localhost:3000/api/users). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/users.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Dev Checklist

Things to be taken care of by every development member
- Next JS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, ESLint
- Place the files/components in the respective modules/folders
- Always consider reusability
- Use Semantic Coding
- Lint all your components and files
- Never add custom CSS, until very necessary. Use [Tailwind utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-sizing) for all customizations
